#checking if the piece is valid (every block touches at least one other)

1. if the x_value is the same as another x_value, and the y_value differs by one, or the y_value is the same as another y_value, and the x_value differs by one, then the piece touches another.

2. once it sees that one x or y value does not match any others, return False
	2.1 loop through the all x values (current_block)
	2.2 	loop through the x values (other_block)
	2.3 		if current_block == other_block:
					send current_block, other_block to step 3.

	//repeat with y values

3. once it sees one matching x or y, take both to the next stage for comparing #assuming x for ease of explanation
	3.1. look at the y values, if abs(other_y - original_y) = 1, then the piece is valid. return True
	3.2. if not, dont return false but keep checking through to see if there are any more matches. if yes then got to line 3.1: "..if abs(other..." if not, return False

4. Finally, if you go through all of this and haven't returned True or False, print("Exception" and display all values (or i can have a breakpoint here))
